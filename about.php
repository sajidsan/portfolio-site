          <h1>About me? <br>I'm blushing.</h1>
          <p>Iâ€™m a product designer at <a href="http://jut.io" target="_blank">Jut</a> helping people make better decisions with data. Before coming to Jut, I worked as a UX designer for Yahoo! Finance after having worked as a full time design researcher with Yahoo!'s larger research team. I've also taught a General Assembly
          <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/online/videos/four-design-research-strategies-for-your-next-project" target="_blank">Class on Research + Strategy</a> and ongoing <a href="http://blogs.academyart.edu/wnm/wnm.html" target="_blank">courses in UX and visual design at the Academy of Arts University</a>.

          Before coming to the Bay Area, I studied design research and interaction design at the <a href="http://www.id.iit.edu" target="_blank">IIT Institute of Design</a> in Chicago and worked on my MBA at the <a href="http://stuart.iit.edu/" target="_blank">Stuart School of Business</a>.  When not dorking out on design, you can find me noodling around in a sketchbook and playing bad hip hop covers on my Casio keyboard. You can check out all of those details here on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sajidreshamwala" target="_blank">Linked In</a>.

          I made <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zNKevDtDBijc.ky0o1S7O3P5Y&usp=sharing" target="_blank">a list of restaurants in SF with drawing paper on their tables</a>.
