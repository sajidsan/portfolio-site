          <h2>Jut Inc.</h2>
          <h5>PRODUCT DESIGN</h5>
          <p>In 2013, Jut was founded to help organizations unify their data by giving them an environment could take in any type of data, modify and combine these different sources with a coding language, and output visualizations and notifications.
            <br>
            <br>
          I joined in late 2014 after the team had built out the base technology and an interface to allow for users to work with this language.I spent the following 15 months helping Jut find its product market fit.

            After getting initial feedback from users on the proof of concept, the team knew one of the challenges would be convincing users to invest in making the switch to a new way of working that had a programming language at its core.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through conversations with our customers, we saw what our users’ workflow looked like and where the largest breakdowns were.

            One of our key insights was, while traditional gui interfaces allowed users to become quickly engaged, they often were limited as time goes on. The Jut language would allow for incredible amounts of flexibility but was incredibly difficult for users to become comfortable.
          </p>
          <p>
            What if we could bridge the gap between the limitations of a GUI interface and the flexibility of a language?

           Our concept was to bridge this gap by filling out Jut’s app ecosystem with two additional apps while connecting the user experience using concepts borrowed from behavior change.

         To make sure the team had a common definition of the problem we were working to solve, we led the team in taking a break to run a design sprint for the first time and developed out a product vision.
